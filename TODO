The Web-to-SMS Gateway that we wanted.

== Next Up:
* show user his api token
* start thinking about billing, so we can send messages to other phone numbers
* enter your mobile number
* invitation codes?

== Technical
* sign up with invitation code
* sandbox for free testing
* admin namespace for us: with API, mac client. :)
* send text messages asynchronously
* open-sourced on GitHub, along with ActiveResource-based client library
* web interface to:
  * manage API keys
  * buy credit
  * view history
* unlimited messages to one phone number? (very useful for developing) (idea needs to be adjusted to prevent / deal with abuse)

== Business Relationships
* talk with Vodacom
* how do we set up a business? Would Nshange sponsor / help out with paperwork?
* where would we host locally? Talk with Kicheko?

== Marketing
* banks? Online balance checking. (Read-only operations are far easier / safer.)
* something like Ushahidi?
* social networking apps only make money by advertising

== Networking
* Richard Manyanza
* Eric Hersman (White African)

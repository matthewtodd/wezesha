The Web-to-SMS Gateway that we wanted.

  * where to host?
  * push code to github

== Technical

* where would we host locally? Talk with Kicheko?

== Marketing
* banks? Online balance checking. (Read-only operations are far easier / safer.)
* something like Ushahidi?
* social networking apps only make money by advertising

* Eric Hersman (White African)



=== Technical Backlog
* Unit test for missing translation keys instead of having Cucumber click to translate every page.
    This is a little hard, since we have a few different sources:
      DONE. 1. Any key in the en.yml file should be present in sw.yml.
      2. Any ActiveRecord attributes should be translated. (But what about timestamps?)
      3. Any Authlogic message should be translated.
      4. Any Rails message from rails-i18n should be translated.

* Fix Ruby.tmbundle so that it can understand filenames filtered with Rails 2.3.0's BacktraceCleaner.
* Find a good way to deal with noun classes in Swahili translations.

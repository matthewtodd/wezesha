The Web-to-SMS Gateway that we wanted.

== Technical
* sandbox for free testing

== Business Relationships
* talk with Vodacom
* how do we set up a business? Would Nshange sponsor / help out with paperwork?
* where would we host locally? Talk with Kicheko?

== Marketing
* banks? Online balance checking. (Read-only operations are far easier / safer.)
* something like Ushahidi?
* social networking apps only make money by advertising

== Networking
* Richard Manyanza
* Eric Hersman (White African)
